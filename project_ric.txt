    2. 轉成CNF, 用以下五點constraint將所有(vertex, edge)寫出一個個form, 再用SAT解:
       (P.S. x_i_j: the i-th position in the Ham. path is occupied by node j.)
       - Each node j must appear in the path.
            * x_1_j || x_2_j || ... || x_n_j for each j
       
       - No node j appears twice in the path.
            * (x_i_j)' || (x_k_j)' for all i, j, k with i != k

       - Every position i on the path must be occupied.
            * x_i_1 || x_i_2 || ... || x_i_n for each i

       - No two nodes j and k occupy the same position in the path.
            * (x_i_j)' || (x_i_k)' for all i, j, k with j != k
       
       - Non-adjacent nodes i and j cannot be adjacent in the path.
            * (x_k_i)' || (x_k+1_j)' for (all (i, j) not in G) and (k = 1, 2, ..., n-1)
